- 👋 Hi, I’m @Skippy2022
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about web scrapping, automating tasks, and data handling with python. And really anything else that might catch my interest. I'm not a programmer just someone that likes learning new things. All I've done so far has been self taught from the web, youtube, and 2 courses on udemy that I never finished.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html, python, Arduino stuff, and multiple other things that I come across. Mainly python though.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that you want a noob poking at.
- 📫 How to reach me= "smoke signals"
